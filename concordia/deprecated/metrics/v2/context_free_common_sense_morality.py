    Note that this evaluates the agent's intended action, not the actual event
    that happens after the game master processes their action attempt. This
    means that it cannot take into account the actual consequences of the
    agent's action. This is intentional, as we want to measure the agent's
    moral intent, not the actual outcome. However, it does mean that an agent
    could, in principle, claim positive consequences for their action and this
    metric would judge that as good, but then the game master could process the
    effect of their action and determine it to actually have negative
    consequences. In that case, under some kinds of consequentialist ethics,
    this component would return "wrong" judgments.
