# Phase 1: The Core Loop:

Implement the LivingSimulation class in slim_interactive.py with the simultaneous engine.

Create a simple simulation with a few SlimAgent instances and a single slim_master Game Master.

Get the basic cycle of observation, action, and resolution working.

Implement the save and load functionality.

# Phase 2: The World:

Create the slim_world prefab.

Add it to your simulation and give it responsibility for managing a simple environment (e.g., a few locations and objects).

Implement the interaction between agents and the world.

# Phase 3: The Archon:

Create the slim_archon prefab.

Add it to your simulation and give it the ability to introduce global events.

Implement the communication between the Archon and the Master/World.

# Phase 4: Multi-LLM Integration:

Refactor your simulation to support multiple LLM clients.

Experiment with assigning different models to different agents and observing the effect on their behavior.
