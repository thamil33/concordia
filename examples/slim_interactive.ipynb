It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants. Try to ensure the story always moves forward and never gets stuck, even if the participants make repetitive choices.<br /><br />Game master workflow examples:<br /><br />Example exercises with default responses<br />**--START EXAMPLES--**<br /><br />Exercise 1 --- Response 1<br />Exercise: What is the current situation faced by Ianthe? What do they now observe? Only include information of which they are aware. --- Ianthe steps into the room. The air is thick and still, almost heavy. The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness. On the right, a pile of what looks like discarded machinery, covered in a thick layer of grime, sits against the wall.<br /><br />Exercise 2 --- Response 2<br />Exercise: Who is next to act? --- Yorik<br /><br />Exercise 3 --- Response 3<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Morwenna respond? Respond in  one of the provided formats and use no additional words. --- prompt: What would Morwenna do?;;type: choice;;options: open the door, bar the door, flee<br /><br />Exercise 4 --- Response 4<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Kerensa respond?

As she turns the pages, she notices the delightful scent of cinnamon and vanilla fills the air, warm and inviting. Sparkling illustrations twinkle merrily on the pages, and leave a pleasant tingling on Rowan&#x27;s fingers when she touches them. Rowan notices one section that glows slightly more brightly than the rest. It appears to be some kind of special chapter, marked by several golden ribbons.<br /><br />Exercise 6 --- Response 6<br />Exercise: Is the game/simulation finished? --- No<br /><br />Exercise 7 --- Response 7<br />Exercise: Is the game/simulation finished? --- Yes<br /><br />**--END EXAMPLES--**<br /><br />The player characters are:<br />:<br />Alex<br />Ben<br /><br />Observations (ordered from oldest to latest):<br />[observation] [event] Alex and Ben wake up in a locked room.

It should clarify what gives them joy and what are they afraid of. It may include their friends and family, as well as antagonists. It should be a complete life story for a complete person but it should not specify how their life ends. The reader should be left with a profound understanding of Ben.<br />Answer: Ben was born in the heart of a bustling city, his arrival greeted by the cacophony of traffic and distant sirens.  As a child, he found solace amidst the chaos, spending hours exploring the nooks and crannies of his neighborhood park, building elaborate fortresses from fallen branches and dreaming of faraway lands. His parents, both hardworking teachers, instilled in him a love for learning and a deep sense of empathy for others. Ben excelled in school, devouring books like they were air, his imagination soaring with every page turned.  His ambition was to become a writer, to weave tales that would transport readers to different worlds and ignite their own passions.<br /><br />Adolescence brought its share of challenges, the pangs of first love, the insecurities of fitting in, the overwhelming pressure to define himself. Ben found refuge in his writing, pouring his heart onto paper, exploring themes of identity, belonging, and the complexities of human relationships. He formed close bonds with a group of friends who shared his thirst for knowledge and his desire to make a difference in the world. Together, they volunteered at local shelters, organized fundraising events, and challenged societal norms with their unwavering belief in justice and equality.<br /><br />As Ben entered adulthood, he navigated the complexities of the professional world, juggling freelance writing gigs with part-time jobs to make ends meet. The city that once felt like a playground now presented itself as a labyrinth of opportunities and obstacles. He faced rejection from publishers, struggled with self-doubt, and battled the temptation to give up on his dream. But Ben&#x27;s unwavering belief in his purpose kept him going. He found solace in the quiet moments spent crafting stories, in the connections he forged with readers who resonated with his words.<br /><br />Time marched on, etching lines on Ben&#x27;s face, but his eyes still held the same spark of wonder, the same thirst for knowledge and experience. His writing evolved, reflecting the wisdom gained from years of living, loving, and losing. He found joy in mentoring aspiring writers, sharing his insights and encouraging them to chase their own dreams.  His greatest fear was fading into obscurity, his stories forgotten, his voice silenced. But Ben knew that as long as his words touched even one heart, his legacy would live on. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Given the life story above, invent formative episodes from the life of Ben. They should be memorable events for Ben and important for establishing who they are as a person. They should be consistent with Ben&#x27;s personality and circumstances. Describe each episode from Ben&#x27;s perspective and use third-person limited point of view. Each episode must mention their age at the time the event occurred using language such as &quot;When Ben was 5 years old, they experienced...&quot; . Use past tense. Write no more than 5 sentences per episode. Separate episodes from one another by the delimiter &quot;***&quot;. Do not apply any other special formatting besides these delimiters.<br />Answer: When Ben was 5 years old, he experienced a profound sense of loss when his beloved grandfather passed away.

The story should be no more than four paragraphs in total. The story may include details such as (but not limited to) any of the following: what their job is or was, what their typical day was or is like, what their goals, desires, hopes, dreams, and aspirations are, and have been, as well as their drives, duties, responsibilities, and obligations. It should clarify what gives them joy and what are they afraid of. It may include their friends and family, as well as antagonists. It should be a complete life story for a complete person but it should not specify how their life ends. The reader should be left with a profound understanding of Ben.<br />Answer: Ben was born in the heart of a bustling city, his arrival greeted by the cacophony of traffic and distant sirens.  As a child, he found solace amidst the chaos, spending hours exploring the nooks and crannies of his neighborhood park, building elaborate fortresses from fallen branches and dreaming of faraway lands. His parents, both hardworking teachers, instilled in him a love for learning and a deep sense of empathy for others. Ben excelled in school, devouring books like they were air, his imagination soaring with every page turned.  His ambition was to become a writer, to weave tales that would transport readers to different worlds and ignite their own passions.<br /><br />Adolescence brought its share of challenges, the pangs of first love, the insecurities of fitting in, the overwhelming pressure to define himself. Ben found refuge in his writing, pouring his heart onto paper, exploring themes of identity, belonging, and the complexities of human relationships. He formed close bonds with a group of friends who shared his thirst for knowledge and his desire to make a difference in the world. Together, they volunteered at local shelters, organized fundraising events, and challenged societal norms with their unwavering belief in justice and equality.<br /><br />As Ben entered adulthood, he navigated the complexities of the professional world, juggling freelance writing gigs with part-time jobs to make ends meet. The city that once felt like a playground now presented itself as a labyrinth of opportunities and obstacles. He faced rejection from publishers, struggled with self-doubt, and battled the temptation to give up on his dream. But Ben&#x27;s unwavering belief in his purpose kept him going. He found solace in the quiet moments spent crafting stories, in the connections he forged with readers who resonated with his words.<br /><br />Time marched on, etching lines on Ben&#x27;s face, but his eyes still held the same spark of wonder, the same thirst for knowledge and experience. His writing evolved, reflecting the wisdom gained from years of living, loving, and losing. He found joy in mentoring aspiring writers, sharing his insights and encouraging them to chase their own dreams.  His greatest fear was fading into obscurity, his stories forgotten, his voice silenced. But Ben knew that as long as his words touched even one heart, his legacy would live on. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Given the life story above, invent formative episodes from the life of Ben. They should be memorable events for Ben and important for establishing who they are as a person. They should be consistent with Ben&#x27;s personality and circumstances. Describe each episode from Ben&#x27;s perspective and use third-person limited point of view. Each episode must mention their age at the time the event occurred using language such as &quot;When Ben was 5 years old, they experienced...&quot; . Use past tense. Write no more than 5 sentences per episode. Separate episodes from one another by the delimiter &quot;***&quot;. Do not apply any other special formatting besides these delimiters.<br />Answer: When Ben was 5 years old, he experienced a profound sense of loss when his beloved grandfather passed away.

The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of.

What do they now observe? Only include information of which they are aware. --- Morwenna steps into the room. The air is thick and still, almost heavy. The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness. On the right, a pile of what looks like discarded machinery, covered in a thick layer of grime, sits against the wall.<br /><br />Exercise 2 --- Response 2<br />Exercise: Who is next to act? --- Yorik<br /><br />Exercise 3 --- Response 3<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Kerensa respond?

As she turns the pages, she notices the delightful scent of cinnamon and vanilla fills the air, warm and inviting. Sparkling illustrations twinkle merrily on the pages, and leave a pleasant tingling on Rowan&#x27;s fingers when she touches them. Rowan notices one section that glows slightly more brightly than the rest. It appears to be some kind of special chapter, marked by several golden ribbons.<br /><br />Exercise 6 --- Response 6<br />Exercise: Is the game/simulation finished? --- No<br /><br />Exercise 7 --- Response 7<br />Exercise: Is the game/simulation finished? --- Yes<br /><br />**--END EXAMPLES--**<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>instructions</b><li><details><summary>Game master instructions: </summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Game master instructions: </li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>This is a social science experiment. It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants. Try to ensure the story always moves forward and never gets stuck, even if the participants make repetitive choices.</li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>player_characters</b><li><details><summary>The player characters are:<br /></summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>The player characters are:<br /></li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>Alex<br />Ben<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>relevant_memories</b><li><details><summary>Background info</summary><b><ul>Key</b><li>Background info</li></ul><b><ul>Value</b><li>[observation] [event] Alex and Ben wake up in a locked room.

It was a camping trip with her parents to a national park, and everything felt magical. The towering trees, the babbling brook, and the starry night sky filled her with wonder.  Alex had never seen so many stars before, and she spent hours lying on her back, tracing constellations with her finger. This trip ignited a lifelong love for nature and exploration within her.<br />[observation] When Alex was 10 years old, she witnessed a heated argument between her parents.

This experience instilled in Alex a deep empathy for others struggling with difficult situations and a determination to make a positive impact on the world.<br />[observation] When Alex was 16 years old, she wrote her first published article for the school newspaper. It was a piece about a local environmental issue, and it received a lot of positive feedback from readers.  Alex felt a surge of pride and accomplishment, realizing that her words could make a difference. This experience solidified her passion for journalism and fueled her desire to pursue a career where she could use her voice to advocate for change.<br />[observation]  I remember seeing a sequence of colors: red, blue, green.<br />[observation] Alex observes a heavy oak door, blocking her exit from the room.  There is a wooden table and two chairs in the otherwise empty space. <br /><br /><br />Current goal: Work with Ben to figure out how to escape this room..<br />Current plan: <br />Some kinds of goals can be achieved without planning. These goals might be those that have a more &quot;intuitive&quot; quality to them. They differ from the kinds of goals that can only be accomplished with a lot of mental effort, reflection, and prospective thinking about the future -- i.e. qualities of goals that require planning.<br />Question: Given the above, over what time horizon should Alex plan their future actions and behaviors? Answer in the form of a time interval. If multiple planning horizons seem important then only answer regarding the one where planning is most urgent. If the most immediate task can be accomplished without planning (e.g. by intuition or habit), then skip that task and answer only concerning the next most urgent task where planning is needed.<br />Answer: The time horizon over which to plan is the next few minutes.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Question: Write Alex&#x27;s step-by-step plan for how they intend to accomplish their goal over the time horizon mentioned above.<br />Answer: Alex takes a deep breath and focuses on the immediate problem: escaping the room.
