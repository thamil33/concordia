# How to contribute

Concordia is an invitation to participate in establishing best practices for the
use of generative AI in agent-based modeling. We are very happy to accept your
patches and contributions to this project.

### Contributing experiments

If you have an exciting experiment that uses Concordia, it is best to keep it
in your own repo. However, we are happy to link to your project from our
[README.md](README.md), please open an issue and tag it with 'link'.

### Contributing components, game master and agent architectures

If your contribution is project specific, for example a specialised component
for weather simulation, it is best placed together with the experiment in your
own repo. 

If your contribution is broadly applicable, we'd be happy to consider adding it
to Concordia. Please open an issue and tag it with 'contribution' to discuss
creating a pull request.

### Bug fixes, etc.

For simple fixes please create a pull request, for more complex problems please
create an issue and label it 'bug'.
