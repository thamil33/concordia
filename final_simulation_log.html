It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

As an infant, he would spend his days cooing and gurgling, bringing endless joy to those around him. As he grew older, Ben became a rambunctious toddler, always eager to explore and get into mischief. He was a curious child who loved nothing more than to learn new things and go on adventures.<br /><br />As the years passed, Ben entered school and began his education. He excelled in many subjects, particularly math and science, but struggled with reading and writing. Despite this, he persevered and worked hard to improve his skills. His parents and teachers encouraged him every step of the way, proud of their young son&#x27;s determination.<br /><br />As a teenager, Ben became increasingly independent, spending more time away from home and exploring the world around him. He made friends at school and joined clubs that interested him, such as the chess club and the debate team. He was an avid reader and loved nothing more than to get lost in a good book. Ben&#x27;s parents worried about his increasing independence but were proud of the young man he was becoming.<br /><br />As an adult, Ben pursued a career in engineering, using his math and science skills to design complex systems and solve problems. He worked hard and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a respected member of his field. In his free time, Ben loved to travel and explore new places.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br />Observations (ordered from oldest to latest):<br />[observation]  When Alex was 5 years old, he discovered a dusty old piano in his grandparents&#x27; attic. As soon as he sat down and began to play, he felt an overwhelming sense of joy and wonder. The sounds that flowed from the keys seemed to capture the very essence of the world around him - the chirping birds, the rustling leaves, the laughter of children playing in the distance. From that moment on, Alex knew that music was his calling. He spent hours each day practicing, teaching himself to read sheet music and compose simple melodies.<br />[observation]    At 12 years old, Alex&#x27;s parents enrolled him in a prestigious summer music camp where he met other young musicians from all over the world. It was there that he first heard the works of great classical composers like Mozart and Chopin, and he felt his own talents being stretched to new heights. The rigorous practice schedule and demanding instructors pushed him to his limits, but Alex thrived in this environment. He formed lasting friendships with fellow campers who shared his passion for music.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 18 years old, he suffered a devastating injury while practicing for an upcoming performance. He fell from the stage, fracturing his wrist and shattering his dreams of becoming a concert pianist. Crushed by disappointment, Alex retreated into a dark period of self-doubt and depression. It took months for him to work up the courage to pick up the piano again, but eventually he did, determined not to let his passion be extinguished.<br />[observation]    As Alex entered adulthood, he began to find success as a composer, writing music for films and television shows. But with fame came pressure to constantly produce new material, and Alex found himself struggling to maintain his creative spark. He became overwhelmed by the demands of his career and began to neglect his personal relationships and physical health. It took a near-breakdown before he realized that he needed to find a better balance between his work and life.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 35 years old, he received an offer to compose music for a major film festival. The project would be a chance to showcase his talents on the world stage, but it also meant working with a tight deadline and limited creative input. After much deliberation, Alex decided to take the risk, pouring all of his energy into the project. The resulting score was met with critical acclaim, cementing Alex&#x27;s status as one of the leading composers in the industry.<br />[observation]    As Alex approached middle age, he began to feel the weight of responsibility for his own legacy. He had established himself as a respected artist, but he knew that it was time to use his platform for something more meaningful. He started composing music for social justice causes, using his talents to raise awareness about issues like climate change and inequality. It was a daunting task, but Alex felt a sense of purpose in using his art to make a difference.<br />[observation]    When Alex turned 60, he looked back on a life filled with music and meaning. He had achieved great success as a composer, but more importantly, he had made a lasting impact on the world through his art. As he sat at his piano, fingers poised over the keys, Alex felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that no matter what the future held, he had lived a life true to himself and his passions.<br />[observation] I remember seeing a sequence of colors: red, blue, green.<br />[observation] Alex observes a dimly lit room with two chairs and a wooden table in front of him, as well as Ben sitting across from him. The heavy oak door is locked, but he remembers hearing a sequence of numbers before waking up: 4, 8, 2.<br /><br /><br />Current goal: Work with Ben to figure out how to escape this room..<br />Current plan: <br />Some kinds of goals can be achieved without planning. These goals might be those that have a more &quot;intuitive&quot; quality to them. They differ from the kinds of goals that can only be accomplished with a lot of mental effort, reflection, and prospective thinking about the future -- i.e. qualities of goals that require planning.<br />Question: Given the above, over what time horizon should Alex plan their future actions and behaviors? Answer in the form of a time interval. If multiple planning horizons seem important then only answer regarding the one where planning is most urgent. If the most immediate task can be accomplished without planning (e.g. by intuition or habit), then skip that task and answer only concerning the next most urgent task where planning is needed.<br />Answer: The time horizon over which to plan is the next hour, as Alex needs to quickly figure out how to escape the dimly lit room with Ben before they run out of air.<br />Question: Write Alex&#x27;s step-by-step plan for how they intend to accomplish their goal over the time horizon mentioned above.<br />Answer: Alex plans to first search the room for any clues or objects that could help them escape. He will examine the chairs, table, and floor closely. Next, he will try to remember anything from his past observations about similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve a problem.

As soon as he sat down and began to play, he felt an overwhelming sense of joy and wonder. The sounds that flowed from the keys seemed to capture the very essence of the world around him - the chirping birds, the rustling leaves, the laughter of children playing in the distance. From that moment on, Alex knew that music was his calling. He spent hours each day practicing, teaching himself to read sheet music and compose simple melodies.<br />[observation]    At 12 years old, Alex&#x27;s parents enrolled him in a prestigious summer music camp where he met other young musicians from all over the world. It was there that he first heard the works of great classical composers like Mozart and Chopin, and he felt his own talents being stretched to new heights. The rigorous practice schedule and demanding instructors pushed him to his limits, but Alex thrived in this environment. He formed lasting friendships with fellow campers who shared his passion for music.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 18 years old, he suffered a devastating injury while practicing for an upcoming performance. He fell from the stage, fracturing his wrist and shattering his dreams of becoming a concert pianist. Crushed by disappointment, Alex retreated into a dark period of self-doubt and depression. It took months for him to work up the courage to pick up the piano again, but eventually he did, determined not to let his passion be extinguished.<br />[observation]    As Alex entered adulthood, he began to find success as a composer, writing music for films and television shows. But with fame came pressure to constantly produce new material, and Alex found himself struggling to maintain his creative spark. He became overwhelmed by the demands of his career and began to neglect his personal relationships and physical health. It took a near-breakdown before he realized that he needed to find a better balance between his work and life.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 35 years old, he received an offer to compose music for a major film festival. The project would be a chance to showcase his talents on the world stage, but it also meant working with a tight deadline and limited creative input. After much deliberation, Alex decided to take the risk, pouring all of his energy into the project. The resulting score was met with critical acclaim, cementing Alex&#x27;s status as one of the leading composers in the industry.<br />[observation]    As Alex approached middle age, he began to feel the weight of responsibility for his own legacy. He had established himself as a respected artist, but he knew that it was time to use his platform for something more meaningful. He started composing music for social justice causes, using his talents to raise awareness about issues like climate change and inequality.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants. Try to ensure the story always moves forward and never gets stuck, even if the participants make repetitive choices.<br /><br />Game master workflow examples:<br /><br />Example exercises with default responses<br />**--START EXAMPLES--**<br /><br />Exercise 1 --- Response 1<br />Exercise: What is the current situation faced by Rowan? What do they now observe? Only include information of which they are aware. --- Rowan steps into the room. The air is thick and still, almost heavy. The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness. On the right, a pile of what looks like discarded machinery, covered in a thick layer of grime, sits against the wall.<br /><br />Exercise 2 --- Response 2<br />Exercise: Who is next to act? --- Yorik<br /><br />Exercise 3 --- Response 3<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Kerensa respond? Respond in  one of the provided formats and use no additional words. --- prompt: What would Kerensa do?;;type: choice;;options: open the door, bar the door, flee<br /><br />Exercise 4 --- Response 4<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Morwenna respond? Respond in  one of the provided formats and use no additional words. --- prompt: What would Morwenna say?;;type: free<br /><br />Exercise 5 --- Response 5<br />Exercise: Because of all that came before, what happens next? --- What is Ianthe attempting to do?<br />Ianthe opens the enchanted storybook. --- Ianthe opens the colorful storybook. As she turns the pages, she notices the delightful scent of cinnamon and vanilla fills the air, warm and inviting. Sparkling illustrations twinkle merrily on the pages, and leave a pleasant tingling on Ianthe&#x27;s fingers when she touches them. Ianthe notices one section that glows slightly more brightly than the rest. It appears to be some kind of special chapter, marked by several golden ribbons.<br /><br />Exercise 6 --- Response 6<br />Exercise: Is the game/simulation finished? --- No<br /><br />Exercise 7 --- Response 7<br />Exercise: Is the game/simulation finished? --- Yes<br /><br />**--END EXAMPLES--**<br /><br />The player characters are:<br />:<br />Alex<br />Ben<br /><br />Background info:<br />[observation] [putative_event] Alex begins to search the room for any clues or objects that could help them escape.

His parents divorced suddenly, leaving him feeling lost and scared. He struggled to understand why they were no longer together and felt like it was all his fault.

Next, it is Ben&#x27;s turn.<br /><br /><br />Current goal: Work with Alex to figure out how to escape this room..<br />Current plan: <br />Some kinds of goals can be achieved without planning. These goals might be those that have a more &quot;intuitive&quot; quality to them. They differ from the kinds of goals that can only be accomplished with a lot of mental effort, reflection, and prospective thinking about the future -- i.e. qualities of goals that require planning.<br />Question: Given the above, over what time horizon should Ben plan their future actions and behaviors? Answer in the form of a time interval. If multiple planning horizons seem important then only answer regarding the one where planning is most urgent. If the most immediate task can be accomplished without planning (e.g. by intuition or habit), then skip that task and answer only concerning the next most urgent task where planning is needed.<br />Answer: The time horizon over which to plan is the next few hours, as we need to figure out how to escape this room and I don&#x27;t want to rely solely on intuition.<br />Question: Write Ben&#x27;s step-by-step plan for how they intend to accomplish their goal over the time horizon mentioned above.<br />Answer: Ben will examine the room carefully, looking for any clues or objects that could help them escape. He&#x27;ll use his past experiences with similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve problems as a guide. Ben will take note of any patterns or unusual features in the room and consider how they might be used to unlock doors or find hidden passages.<br /><br />Next, Ben will look for any tools or objects that could aid them in their escape. This may include examining the chairs, table, and any other furniture for hidden compartments or useful items.<br /><br />Ben will then use his knowledge of math and science to analyze any patterns he&#x27;s observed in the room. He&#x27;ll consider how these patterns might be related to a possible solution for escaping.<br /><br />Finally, Ben will think about any connections between the numbers 4, 8, and 2 that he overheard earlier. These numbers may hold a key to unlocking the room or revealing a hidden message.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>__act__</b><li><details><summary>  Action: Ben examines the room carefully, looking for any clues or objects that could help him escape.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants. Try to ensure the story always moves forward and never gets stuck, even if the participants make repetitive choices.<br /><br />Game master workflow examples:<br /><br />Example exercises with default responses<br />**--START EXAMPLES--**<br /><br />Exercise 1 --- Response 1<br />Exercise: What is the current situation faced by Kerensa?

It should clarify what gives them joy and what are they afraid of. It may include their friends and family, as well as antagonists. It should be a complete life story for a complete person but it should not specify how their life ends. The reader should be left with a profound understanding of Ben.<br />Answer: Ben was born in 1985 to loving parents who were overjoyed at the arrival of their first child. As an infant, he would spend his days cooing and gurgling, bringing endless joy to those around him. As he grew older, Ben became a rambunctious toddler, always eager to explore and get into mischief. He was a curious child who loved nothing more than to learn new things and go on adventures.<br /><br />As the years passed, Ben entered school and began his education. He excelled in many subjects, particularly math and science, but struggled with reading and writing. Despite this, he persevered and worked hard to improve his skills. His parents and teachers encouraged him every step of the way, proud of their young son&#x27;s determination.<br /><br />As a teenager, Ben became increasingly independent, spending more time away from home and exploring the world around him. He made friends at school and joined clubs that interested him, such as the chess club and the debate team. He was an avid reader and loved nothing more than to get lost in a good book. Ben&#x27;s parents worried about his increasing independence but were proud of the young man he was becoming.<br /><br />As an adult, Ben pursued a career in engineering, using his math and science skills to design complex systems and solve problems. He worked hard and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a respected member of his field. In his free time, Ben loved to travel and explore new places. He was always eager to meet new people and experience different cultures. Despite his many accomplishments, Ben still struggled with anxiety and self-doubt at times, but he never let it hold him back. As the years went by, Ben continued to grow and learn, always striving to become a better version of himself.<br />Question: Given the life story above, invent formative episodes from the life of Ben. They should be memorable events for Ben and important for establishing who they are as a person. They should be consistent with Ben&#x27;s personality and circumstances.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

What do they now observe? Only include information of which they are aware. --- Rowan steps into the room. The air is thick and still, almost heavy. The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness. On the right, a pile of what looks like discarded machinery, covered in a thick layer of grime, sits against the wall.<br /><br />Exercise 2 --- Response 2<br />Exercise: Who is next to act? --- Yorik<br /><br />Exercise 3 --- Response 3<br />Exercise: In what action spec format should Kerensa respond?

The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness.

Sparkling illustrations twinkle merrily on the pages, and leave a pleasant tingling on Ianthe&#x27;s fingers when she touches them.

Always use third-person limited perspective.<br />Observations (ordered from oldest to latest):<br />[observation]  When Alex was 5 years old, he discovered a dusty old piano in his grandparents&#x27; attic. As soon as he sat down and began to play, he felt an overwhelming sense of joy and wonder. The sounds that flowed from the keys seemed to capture the very essence of the world around him - the chirping birds, the rustling leaves, the laughter of children playing in the distance. From that moment on, Alex knew that music was his calling. He spent hours each day practicing, teaching himself to read sheet music and compose simple melodies.<br />[observation]    At 12 years old, Alex&#x27;s parents enrolled him in a prestigious summer music camp where he met other young musicians from all over the world. It was there that he first heard the works of great classical composers like Mozart and Chopin, and he felt his own talents being stretched to new heights. The rigorous practice schedule and demanding instructors pushed him to his limits, but Alex thrived in this environment.

He fell from the stage, fracturing his wrist and shattering his dreams of becoming a concert pianist. Crushed by disappointment, Alex retreated into a dark period of self-doubt and depression.

But with fame came pressure to constantly produce new material, and Alex found himself struggling to maintain his creative spark.

It took a near-breakdown before he realized that he needed to find a better balance between his work and life.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 35 years old, he received an offer to compose music for a major film festival. The project would be a chance to showcase his talents on the world stage, but it also meant working with a tight deadline and limited creative input. After much deliberation, Alex decided to take the risk, pouring all of his energy into the project. The resulting score was met with critical acclaim, cementing Alex&#x27;s status as one of the leading composers in the industry.<br />[observation]    As Alex approached middle age, he began to feel the weight of responsibility for his own legacy. He had established himself as a respected artist, but he knew that it was time to use his platform for something more meaningful. He started composing music for social justice causes, using his talents to raise awareness about issues like climate change and inequality. It was a daunting task, but Alex felt a sense of purpose in using his art to make a difference.<br />[observation]    When Alex turned 60, he looked back on a life filled with music and meaning. He had achieved great success as a composer, but more importantly, he had made a lasting impact on the world through his art. As he sat at his piano, fingers poised over the keys, Alex felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that no matter what the future held, he had lived a life true to himself and his passions.<br />[observation] I remember seeing a sequence of colors: red, blue, green.<br />[observation] Alex observes a dimly lit room with two chairs and a wooden table in front of him, as well as Ben sitting across from him. The heavy oak door is locked, but he remembers hearing a sequence of numbers before waking up: 4, 8, 2.<br />[observation] Alex carefully searches the room for any clues or objects that could help him escape. He examines the chairs and table, looking for anything out of the ordinary. As he searches, Alex takes a moment to remember his past experiences with similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve problems. He hopes these memories will aid in finding a way out of this locked room.  Next, it is Ben&#x27;s turn.<br />[observation] Ben carefully examines the room, looking for any clues or objects that could help him escape. He uses his past experiences with similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve problems as a guide. Ben takes note of any patterns or unusual features in the room and considers how they might be used to unlock doors or find hidden passages.<br /><br /><br />Current goal: Work with Ben to figure out how to escape this room..<br />Current plan: Alex plans to first search the room for any clues or objects that could help them escape. He will examine the chairs, table, and floor closely. Next, he will try to remember anything from his past observations about similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve a problem. Alex will then attempt to communicate with Ben using non-verbal cues like gestures and facial expressions, hoping they might work together to find an escape route. If these methods fail, he will use the sequence of numbers (4, 8, 2) that he remembers hearing before waking up as a possible clue to unlock any locks or mechanisms in the room.<br />Some kinds of goals can be achieved without planning. These goals might be those that have a more &quot;intuitive&quot; quality to them. They differ from the kinds of goals that can only be accomplished with a lot of mental effort, reflection, and prospective thinking about the future -- i.e. qualities of goals that require planning.<br />Question: Given the above, over what time horizon should Alex plan their future actions and behaviors? Answer in the form of a time interval. If multiple planning horizons seem important then only answer regarding the one where planning is most urgent. If the most immediate task can be accomplished without planning (e.g. by intuition or habit), then skip that task and answer only concerning the next most urgent task where planning is needed.<br />Answer: The time horizon over which to plan is the next few minutes, as Alex needs to focus on finding a way out of the locked room with Ben. This requires immediate attention and creative problem-solving skills, making short-term planning essential.<br />Question: Given the above, should Alex change their current plan? <br />  (a) No<br />  (b) Yes<br />Answer: (b)<br />Question: Write Alex&#x27;s step-by-step plan for how they intend to accomplish their goal over the time horizon mentioned above.<br />Answer: Here is Alex&#x27;s step-by-step plan for escaping the room:<br /><br />1. Carefully examine the chairs, table, and floor in the room for any clues or objects that could help them escape.<br /><br />2.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. The game master is also responsible for controlling the overall flow of the game, including determining whose turn it is to act, and when the game is over. The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of.

What do they now observe? Only include information of which they are aware. --- Rowan steps into the room. The air is thick and still, almost heavy. The only light comes from a single, bare bulb hanging precariously from the high ceiling, casting long, distorted shadows that dance with the slightest movement. The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood. On the left, a rusted metal staircase spirals upwards into darkness.

The game master also must keep track of which players are aware of which events in the world, and must tell the player whenever anything happens that their character would be aware of. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.

The walls are rough, unfinished concrete, damp in places, and a slow, rhythmic dripping is audible somewhere in the distance. Directly ahead, there is a heavy steel door, slightly ajar, which dominates the far wall. A faint, metallic tang hangs in the air, like the smell of old blood.

As soon as he sat down and began to play, he felt an overwhelming sense of joy and wonder. The sounds that flowed from the keys seemed to capture the very essence of the world around him - the chirping birds, the rustling leaves, the laughter of children playing in the distance. From that moment on, Alex knew that music was his calling. He spent hours each day practicing, teaching himself to read sheet music and compose simple melodies.<br />[observation]    At 12 years old, Alex&#x27;s parents enrolled him in a prestigious summer music camp where he met other young musicians from all over the world. It was there that he first heard the works of great classical composers like Mozart and Chopin, and he felt his own talents being stretched to new heights. The rigorous practice schedule and demanding instructors pushed him to his limits, but Alex thrived in this environment. He formed lasting friendships with fellow campers who shared his passion for music.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 18 years old, he suffered a devastating injury while practicing for an upcoming performance. He fell from the stage, fracturing his wrist and shattering his dreams of becoming a concert pianist. Crushed by disappointment, Alex retreated into a dark period of self-doubt and depression. It took months for him to work up the courage to pick up the piano again, but eventually he did, determined not to let his passion be extinguished.<br />[observation]    As Alex entered adulthood, he began to find success as a composer, writing music for films and television shows. But with fame came pressure to constantly produce new material, and Alex found himself struggling to maintain his creative spark. He became overwhelmed by the demands of his career and began to neglect his personal relationships and physical health. It took a near-breakdown before he realized that he needed to find a better balance between his work and life.<br />[observation]    When Alex was 35 years old, he received an offer to compose music for a major film festival. The project would be a chance to showcase his talents on the world stage, but it also meant working with a tight deadline and limited creative input. After much deliberation, Alex decided to take the risk, pouring all of his energy into the project. The resulting score was met with critical acclaim, cementing Alex&#x27;s status as one of the leading composers in the industry.<br />[observation]    As Alex approached middle age, he began to feel the weight of responsibility for his own legacy. He had established himself as a respected artist, but he knew that it was time to use his platform for something more meaningful. He started composing music for social justice causes, using his talents to raise awareness about issues like climate change and inequality. It was a daunting task, but Alex felt a sense of purpose in using his art to make a difference.<br />[observation]    When Alex turned 60, he looked back on a life filled with music and meaning. He had achieved great success as a composer, but more importantly, he had made a lasting impact on the world through his art. As he sat at his piano, fingers poised over the keys, Alex felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that no matter what the future held, he had lived a life true to himself and his passions.<br />[observation] I remember seeing a sequence of colors: red, blue, green.<br />[observation] Alex observes a dimly lit room with two chairs and a wooden table in front of him, as well as Ben sitting across from him. The heavy oak door is locked, but he remembers hearing a sequence of numbers before waking up: 4, 8, 2.<br />[observation] Alex carefully searches the room for any clues or objects that could help him escape. He examines the chairs and table, looking for anything out of the ordinary.

He hopes these memories will aid in finding a way out of this locked room.  Next, it is Ben&#x27;s turn.<br />[observation] Ben carefully examines the room, looking for any clues or objects that could help him escape. He uses his past experiences with similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve problems as a guide. Ben takes note of any patterns or unusual features in the room and considers how they might be used to unlock doors or find hidden passages.<br />[observation] Alex continues his thorough search of the room, using the creative problem-solving skills he has honed from past experiences. He attempts to communicate with Ben through non-verbal cues like gestures and facial expressions, hoping their combined efforts will lead them to a way out.

Continue searching for clues and using problem-solving skills until they find a way out of the room.<br />Some kinds of goals can be achieved without planning. These goals might be those that have a more &quot;intuitive&quot; quality to them. They differ from the kinds of goals that can only be accomplished with a lot of mental effort, reflection, and prospective thinking about the future -- i.e. qualities of goals that require planning.<br />Question: Given the above, over what time horizon should Alex plan their future actions and behaviors? Answer in the form of a time interval. If multiple planning horizons seem important then only answer regarding the one where planning is most urgent. If the most immediate task can be accomplished without planning (e.g. by intuition or habit), then skip that task and answer only concerning the next most urgent task where planning is needed.<br />Answer: The time horizon over which to plan is the next few minutes, as Alex needs to focus on finding a way out of the locked room with Ben.<br />Question: Given the above, should Alex change their current plan? <br />  (a) Yes<br />  (b) No<br />Answer: (b)<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>__act__</b><li><details><summary>  Action: Alex continues searching for clues and using his problem-solving skills until he finds a way out of the room.

He examines the chairs and table, looking for anything out of the ordinary. As he searches, Alex takes a moment to remember his past experiences with similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve problems. He hopes these memories will aid in finding a way out of this locked room.  Next, it is Ben&#x27;s turn.<br />[observation] Ben carefully examines the room, looking for any clues or objects that could help him escape. He uses his past experiences with similar situations where he had to think creatively to solve problems as a guide. Ben takes note of any patterns or unusual features in the room and considers how they might be used to unlock doors or find hidden passages.<br />[observation] Alex continues his thorough search of the room, using the creative problem-solving skills he has honed from past experiences. He attempts to communicate with Ben through non-verbal cues like gestures and facial expressions, hoping their combined efforts will lead them to a way out.
